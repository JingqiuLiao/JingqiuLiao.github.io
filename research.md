### Biogeography of edaphic _Listeria_ 

![image-right](/assets/images/Research1.png){: .align-right}
_Listeria_ is a diverse Gram-positive bacterial genus, which contains 2 pathogenic (_L. monocytogenes_ and _L. ivanovii_) and 18 non-pathogenic species. Soil, the primary habitat of _Listeria_, is a critical transmission source of _Listeria_ to plants, animals, and food chains. I'm conducting soil sampling at a nation-wide scale to decipher the biogeographic pattern of _Listeria_ in soil from natural environment. By quantifying the importance of soil properties, landscape, and neutral factors, and by using population genomics, I explore the influence of various ecological and evolutionary processes on the distribution of _Listeria_.

### Microevolution of antimicrobial-resistant _Samonella enterica_

_S. enterica_, an important human and animal pathogen, contains >2,500 recognized serotypes, which display a broad range of epidemiological and ecological characteristics. The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains of _S. enterica_ poses a growing threat to public health. By using comparative genomics, I examine how antimicrobial-resisatant _S. enterica_ representing distinct serotypes differ in genomic content and microevolutionary pattern, and the impact of host range, host type and geographic origin on the arising of genetic variations. I also investigate the role of positive selection in the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, host adaptation and serotype diversification in _S. enterica_.

### Ecological forces of edaphic _Escherichia coli_

While providing essential ecosystem services, high quality habitat (e.g., forest) for wildlife in watershed adjacent to produce fields may increase risk for contamination of agricultural products by enteric bacteria, including _E. coli_. In order to understand how landscape of watershed influences the biogeographic pattern of edaphic _E. coli_, I compare the distribution of _E. coli_ collected from watersheds with different landscape patterns, and assess the effect of environmental selection and dispersal including neutral dispersal and wildlife-driven dispersal on the distribution of _E. coli_.

### Assembly mechanism of bacterial communities 

![image-right](/assets/images/Research4.png){: .align-right}
The mechanisms underpinning the assembly of bacterial communities have been under debate for a long time on two schools of thoughts - deterministic theory and neutral theory. My previous efforts in understanding the assembly of bacterial communities in lake and oil-contaminated soil suggest that deterministic and neutral processes are joinly responsible for bacterial assembly, and the importance of those processes vary with different bacterial groups by traits (e.g., relative abundance, habbitat specialization). Bacterial communities in nature are diverse and complex. I'm highly motivated to fully understand the assembly mechanism of bacterial communities by taking eco-evolutionary factors, temporal factor and spatial scales into account, and by separately investigating bacteria with different characteristics in terms of phylogeny, function, and diversity.
