### Large-scale biogeography ~ Genomics

![image-right](/assets/images/Research/Slide1.png){: .align-right}
As the most abundant and diverse organisms on Earth, microbes' distribution in nature remain largely undocumented, particularly at a large spatial scale. To enrich microbial databases and to improve the understanding of biological strategies that microbes adopt to occupy niches, we conducted nation-wide soil sampling to collect _Listeria_ from natural environments across the contiguous US. _Listeria_ is a diverse Gram-positive bacterial genus, which includes the major causative agent of food-borne disease listeriosis, _L. monocytogenes_. By mining genomic and environmental data, I explore mechanisms underlying the niche breadth of _Listeria_.

Check out this fun video showing how we obtained and processed soil samples! Shout out to our amazing sampling team! Thanks to the hard work in sampling at such a large scale, a number of new (and weird) _Listeria_ species have been discovered.

### Population structure ~ Environment 

Genetic variation in a bacterial population can occur as a result of dissimilarities of ecological niches, which may represent distinct habitats, hosts, and geographic locations. To identify environment-associated population structure and evolutionary drivers of genetic diversity, I study two bacteria important to public health, _Listeria_ and _Salmonella_, using tools of population genomics and population genetics.

While _Listeria_ primarily inhabits in natural environments, it has been frequently isolated from food-associated environments, which pose thread to food safety. To identify genetic evidence of ecological differentiation and inter-environment transmission, I characterize _Listeria_ isolates collected from soil, food processing facilities, and agricultural water using whole genome sequencing and compare a number of genomic features between isolates from natural and food-associated environments using differential analyses.

Sequencing of _sigB_, which encodes a stress responsive alternative sigma factor, has emerged as a widely used molecular tool for rapid classification of diverse _Listeria_ isolates. To assess the validity of _sigB_ allelic typing for _Listeria_, we characterized evolutionary patterns of _sigB_ and found that _sigB_ is a relatively stable gene free from frequent homologous recombination and positive selection. _sigB_ allelic typing is an useful tool for _Listeria_ species classification.

_S. enterica_, an important human and animal pathogen, contains >2,500 recognized serotypes, which display different epidemiological and ecological characteristics. The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) strains of _S. enterica_ poses a growing threat to public health. I carried out two studies assessing the micro-evolutionary patterns of AMR _S. enterica_: i) population structure associated with host range, in which we found evidence that recent population bottleneck and genome decay are linked to the narrow host range of AMR _S. enterica_ host-adapted serotypes; and ii) population structure associated with host species and geographic origins, in which we showed that presence/absence profiles of functional genes and pseudo-genes (e.g., virulence genes) vary by host species of AMR _S. enterica_, while geographic origin appears to be more important in effecting genetic diversity of AMR _S. enterica_ at single nucleotide polymorphism level.

### Distribution and diversity ~ Ecological forces

Understanding ecological forces driving the change in microbial composition from local to regional scales is a central theme in microbial ecology and biogeography. It is known that microbial distribution and diversity can be governed by deterministic and neutral ecological processes jointly. My goal is to disentangle the roles of ecological processes underlying the distribution and diversity of microbes from specific environments and to seek generic principles. I study model organisms as well as microbial communities with a focus on selection, dispersal, and drift.

High quality habitat (e.g., forest) for wildlife in watershed adjacent to produce fields may increase risk for contamination of agricultural products by enteric bacteria, including _E. coli_. Understanding how landscape of watershed impacts the distribution of edaphic _E. coli_ is thus of great importance in this aspect. By sampling and characterizing _E. coli_ from watersheds dominated by either forest or produce fields and developing wildlife-driven dispersal models, we found that watershed landscape patterns influences the distribution of _E. coli_ by adjusting the importance of environmental selection and dispersal.

How mechanisms underlying the distribution of microbial groups with different traits is yet to be fully understood. To this end, I conducted a series of studies quantifying deterministic and neutral effects on the community assembly of bacteria sampled from high-altitude freshwater lakes in China. We found that i) habitat generalists are mainly driven by neutral processes; ii) habitat specialists are only governed by deterministic processes, with salinity identified as the top driver; iii) both abundant and rare taxa were strongly influenced by deterministic processes, but the key environmental variables differed between the two groups; and iv)_Cyanobacteria_, which is essential for sustaining the productivity of ecosystems, is assembled via
deterministic processes driven by water property, lake morphology and watershed land-use.

While crude oil extraction is of immense importance for energy and economy, hydrocarbons in the oil can be extremely toxic to living organisms and can interfere with the balance and function of ecosystems. Apparently, oil can also change the structure and function of microbial community in soil. By sampling and characterizing soil microbial communities from four major oil fields in China, we identified the direct and indirect impacts of oil contamination on the distribution of microbial communities, and found oil contamination lead to a drastic increase in the relative abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and a reduction of nitrogen-transforming bacteria in soils regardless of the soil types.
