I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Microbiology](https://micro.cornell.edu){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Dr. Martin Wiedmann](https://foodsafety.foodscience.cornell.edu){:target="_blank"} at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu){:target="_blank"} and was a Ph.D. exchange student advised by [Dr. Otto Cordero](https://www.corderolab.org/research/){:target="_blank"} at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu){:target="_blank"}. Before these, I obtained my M.S. in Environmental Sciences from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} where I started out my academic journey. 

My research interests span microbial evolution and ecology, microbial biogeography, environmental microbiology, and population genomics. In particular, I like playing "hide-and-seek" games with bacteria. By discovering them from different environments, I characterize the distribution of bacteria at scales ranging from local to nationwide, and decipher ecological and evolutionary mechanisms (e.g., selection, dispersal, drift, and divergence) underlying bacterial biogeography. My research involves a combination of field work, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics. I enjoy [photography](https://500px.com/cccelialiao){:target="_blank"}, tennis, [piano](https://list.youku.com/albumlist/show/id_51847948.html?spm=a2h0j.11185381.bpmodule-playpage-righttitle.5~H2~A){:target="_blank"}, ukulele, and [cooking](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9taqK59gWNfDu55JA){:target="_blank"} when I'm not engaged in academic pursuits.
