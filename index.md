Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in [Tal Korem's lab](https://www.koremlab.science){:target="_blank"} at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu){:target="_blank"}. I received my PhD in microbiology at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu){:target="_blank"} advised by [Martin Wiedmann](https://foodsafety.foodscience.cornell.edu){:target="_blank"} and was a PhD exchange student at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu){:target="_blank"} advised by [Otto Cordero](https://www.corderolab.org/research/){:target="_blank"}. I obtained my MS in environmental science at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} where I started out my academic journey. 

My research interests span microbial evolution, microbial ecology, environmental microbiology, and microbial genomics. In particular, I like playing "hide-and-seek" games with microbes. After chasing them down in different environments at local to nationwide scales, I study how evolutionary and ecological processes shape the distribution and structure of microbial populations and communities. Diving in the ocean of ATGC, I look for genetic markers that contribute to the adaptation of microbes to specific environments in the real world. My research involves a combination of field sampling, microbial isolation, high-throughput sequencing, modeling, and bioinformatics. I enjoy [photography](https://500px.com/cccelialiao){:target="_blank"}, tennis, [piano](https://list.youku.com/albumlist/show/id_51847948.html?spm=a2h0j.11185381.bpmodule-playpage-righttitle.5~H2~A){:target="_blank"}, ukulele, and [cooking](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9taqK59gWNfDu55JA){:target="_blank"} when I'm not engaged in academic pursuits.
